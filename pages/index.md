{:.no_toc}

![img/rse-ops-librarian.png](img/rse-ops-librarian.png)

Welcome to the RSE-ops Docs Jekyll example site! 

This is an example project that shows how to use the [rseops-docs-jekyll](https://github.com/rse-ops/rseops-docs-jekyll) theme. This theme is intended for RSE-ops developers that want to provide documentation alongside their tool or RSE-ops community project that will render to match <a href="https://rse-rse-ops.github.io" target="_blank">the main RSE-ops site</a>. To get your tool linked from the main site, you can open an issue or pull request <a href="https://github.com/rse-ops/rse-ops.github.io/issues">there</a>. You can explore the sidebar on the left to see how the sidebars work, or if you have a question or feature request please <a href="https://github.com/rse-ops/rseops-docs-jekyll/issues" target="_blank">let us know!</a>
